## Description of project
 
Game of Checkers (Draughts) in Java. After using the console as an output, I began exploring existing Java GUI libraries and more advanced data structures to represent a game of checkers. The game can be played against an AI opponent and provides a windowed user interface for the player to make moves and view the results.
